## 🧠 Example Use Case

You can define household rules such as:
- Pizza is categorized as "Weekend Food", so it appears only on Fridays or Saturdays
- Every Monday is "Milanesa Day", and optionally on Wednesday or Thursday
- Tuesdays are always "Pasta Day"

The app takes these preferences into account when generating the weekly menu.
